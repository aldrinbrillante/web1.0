						<h2>About the Author</h2>
						<p>Born and raised in poverty in the streets of the Philippines,
							Aldrin Brillante's story is quite unconventional in comparison to 
							the average adult. Growing up with almost nothing to own, Aldrin and
							his family had to work long and odd hours to find enough money and connections to be able
							to move to the United States. Once there, life was not much easier for the Brillante family,
							having to battle racial discrimination in a close-minded community. Eager to lighten the burden
							of himself from his family, Aldrin sought off on his own as soon as he became of age.
							Leaving home, Aldrin spent the first few months couch-surfing and, at times, homeless in
							the different citites he travled. Desperate for money and a better future, he soon signed
							up to join the military, joining and signing with the Navy as a Special Amphibious
							Reconnaissance Corpsman, deploying and detaching with numerous missions in whatever he was tasked with. 
							Throughout his life experiences, Aldrin was able to travel the world in both work and leisure, enjoying
							the luxuries of more than 40 countries and more than 100 cultures.
							<br>
							<br>
							He now writes this single page site in hopes for a good score.
